# REntropy

This application is written in BASH script.

### No Installation Required
This script will need to be updated so that your target Youtube channel is specified. To specify channel, edit firstIter.sh
```
126 channel="http://URL.to/target/channel"
```

### Usage
```
./firstIter.sh
./secondIter.sh
./thirdIter.sh <Channel>
```

### ToDo
- thirdIter.sh needs to be modified such that it can handle command line args.
- firstIter.sh needs to be modified such that it takes in command line arguments pointing to the channel to scrape.
