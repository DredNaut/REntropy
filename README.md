# REntropy

This application is written in BASH script.

### No Installation Required
```
// To the directory of your choice
git clone https://github.com.com/drednaut/REntropy.git 
```

### Usage
```
./firstIter.sh <User Channel>
./secondIter.sh
./thirdIter.sh <Channel Within Channel Tab>
```

### ToDo
- thirdIter.sh needs to be modified such that it can handle command line args.
- firstIter.sh needs to be modified such that it takes in command line arguments pointing to the channel to scrape.
